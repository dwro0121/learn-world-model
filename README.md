## What this course covers

Five lectures and six projects that take you from the intuition behind world models to training, evaluating, and causally probing modern world-model systems.

| # | Type | Title | Core Topics |
|---|------|-------|-------------|
| L01 | Lecture | Internal Simulation & Historical Context | Craik's mental models, predictive coding, four eras of world model evolution |
| L02 | Lecture | Observation Encoding & Latent Dynamics | VAE, CNN encoder, ELBO, GRU → MDN-RNN → RSSM |
| L03 | Lecture | Architecture Patterns, Learning Paradigms & Planning | Planning and control, backbone selection, nine architecture families, optional frontier survey |
| L04 | Lecture | Diagnosing World Models | Representation, dynamics, rollout, task-signal, planning, and deployment diagnostics |
| L05 | Lecture | Frontier Debates | Language vs physical grounding, Bitter Lesson, AGI as a research target |
| P01 | Project | Train a VAE Encoder | Small CNN VAE on 64×64 pixels. ELBO loss curve. Latent slider visualization |
| P02 | Project | Build an RSSM Dynamics Model | GRU, MDN-RNN, and RSSM compared. Prior vs posterior rollout plots |
| P03 | Project | Train a Dreamer Agent | Full training loop: encoder + RSSM + latent Actor-Critic on a small pixel env |
| P04 | Project | Swap the Dynamics Backbone | Replace RSSM with a small causal Transformer (STORM-style). Architecture comparison |
| P05 | Project | World Model Evaluation Dashboard | Per-model metrics side by side: FID, reward correlation, PSNR, latent drift |
| P06 | Project | Counterfactual Action-Conditioned World Model | Interventional and counterfactual rollouts, inverse-dynamics regularization, action-influence metric |

| Dynamics | L02: Latent Dynamics | P02: Build an RSSM Dynamics Model |
| Control | L03: Planning and Control | P03: Train a Dreamer Agent |
| Backbone choice | L03: Backbone Selection | P04: Swap the Dynamics Backbone |
| Research orientation | L03: Optional Frontier Survey | Optional reading, no project prerequisite |
| Diagnosis | L04: Diagnosing World Models | P05: Evaluation Dashboard and P06: Counterfactual Fidelity |
| Open questions | L05 | Synthesize the unresolved debates |

Suggested path: L01, L02 Observation Encoding, P01, L02 Latent Dynamics, P02, L03 Planning and Control, P03, L03 Backbone Selection, P04, optional L03 frontier survey, L04, P05, P06, L05.

You do not need to finish all theory before starting a project. Build, then come back with questions.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome. Before submitting a pull request, read [CLAUDE.md](./CLAUDE.md) for the writing style rules that apply to all lecture and project files (no em dashes, no linear mermaid diagrams, no arrow-chain prose, EN/ZH sync, and others). Content that does not follow those rules will be asked to revise before merging.
